mo-rlglue-python-codec
======================

I have modified some of the files in the original rlglue-python-codec
to handle multiple objectives.
Changes are indicated in respective files through comments.

Source for rlglue for multiple objectives: http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/mo-rl-glue/
from the paper:

Issabekov, R., & Vamplew, P. (2012). An empirical comparison of two common multiobjective 
reinforcement learning algorithms. In AI 2012: Advances in Artificial Intelligence 
(pp. 626-636). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

Compile and install morl\_glue as regular rlglue installation. (follow instructions given there!)
